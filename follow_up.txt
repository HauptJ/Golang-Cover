To whom it may concern,

Earlier this week, I submitted an application for an engineering position at test 10b. I would just like to confirm the receipt of my application and reiterate my interest in the position.

For reference, I have pasted the position title below.

I am very interested in working with test 10b, and I believe my technical and leadership skills would be an ideal match for this position.

I attached a copy of my CV which includes a detailed list of all my projects, as well as links to them on GitHub. If you have any questions, or need any further materials from me, please let me know.

Thank You,
